         <p> Carlo Ancelotti has decided to change his game plan for Real Madrid and now play with four players in midfield.According to Spanish newspaper Marca، the Italian coach will play in a 4-4-2 formation for the upcoming matches، with Tchouameni، Camavinga، Valverde and Bellingham playing in midfield.
         According to Carlo Ancelotti's new plan, one of Rodrygo, Mbappe and Vinicius should be on the reserve bench and be the victim of the plan.</p><p>According to the report، Bellingham will have to forget about his style of play last season، when he played as a free agent and will have to help his team's left-back in midfield this season.

         Real Madrid's coaching staff expects Camavinga to return to the pitch earlier than usual next week، paving the way for Ancelotti's plan to go ahead.

         Real Madrid are second in La Liga with 11 points from five games this season and four points behind leaders Barcelona</p>
